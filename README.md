The objective is to just create a cool chatbot. OpenAI handles all of the conversation or "thinking". Let's turn it into an API AGI that can connect to multiple devices as a useful friend. For my personal use I connect to the script over bluetooth and just inquire throughout the day. I have also tested using it to control ROKU, Google nest, and even assist me with handling customer emails and responses. Creating an all in one on the go solution that can run on low powered devices, access local networks, and maintain files all with voice control. I really wanted to have openai in the time where I was a Google Glass user, but lets just keep trucking forward.
